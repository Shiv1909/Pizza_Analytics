# Pizza_Analytics
Introduction

In this repository, I'll be sharing an end-to-end project that demonstrates my skills in data analysis, visualization, and SQL querying. This project showcases my journey from gathering raw data to creating insightful visualizations using Microsoft Power BI and SQL.

The analysis of the pizza orders dataset uncovers noteworthy trends. Orders peak during weekends, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings. July and January emerge as the months with the highest order volumes. The "Classic" category stands out with the most sales and orders, while large-sized pizzas dominate sales. Among specific pizzas, "Thai Chicken" leads in revenue, "Classic" in total quantities, and "Classic Delux" in total orders. On the flip side, "BIre Carre" records the least revenue, total quantities, and total orders. These insights offer valuable guidance for understanding customer preferences and making informed business decisions.
